# DeepNLP AI APP Store
DeepNLP AI Store (http://www.deepnlp.org/store) is a newly released website to let users write genuine reviews, ratings, human evaluation, prompts and share use cases
about detailed aspects of AI services from users' perspective (different from researchers' perspective like the LLM/MultiModal benchmarks). 
DeepNLP wants to build the platform referred as the "Yelp" of AI services, which stems from its role in providing a platform where users can discover and connect with various AI services, AI Apps and Robotics community and ease the burden of customers choosing various AI services, similar to how Yelp helps users find local businesses and services.

## Detailed AI Service Use Case
Users can write detailed reviews about some functions about an AI service (ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity/Midjourney/) like how AI is doing on "Correct Grammarly Mistakes in Essays", 
"Acting like doctors about Illness", or text-to-image ability like "Generate Cartoon Characters", "Draw Picture of Fantasy Humanoid", by uploading the screenshots
of a conversation or the generated images of AI image generator.

## Multi-Aspect Rating
Users can write review and give overall rating from 1 to 5 to each function of AI service, 
as well as give detailed rating of different aspects of each function, including "Correctness", "Helpfulness" and "Interesting", 
and customized aspects of each function, such as "Clarity of image", "Image Resolution", "Artistic", "Grammar", "Succintness" and more.

tensorflow (1.0-1.3), use deepnlp = 0.1.6 version
tensorflow (1.4), use deepnlp = 0.1.7 version
See RELEASE.md for more details


* Pip
```python
    # linux, run the script:
    pip install deepnlp
```
Due to pkg size restriction, english pos model, ner domain specific model files are not distributed on pypi
You can download the pre-trained model files from github and put in your installation directory .../site-packages/.../deepnlp/...
model files: ../pos/ckpt/en/pos.ckpt  ; ../ner/ckpt/zh/ner.ckpt

* Source Distribution, e.g. deepnlp-0.1.7.tar.gz: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepnlp

```python
    # linux, run the script:
    tar zxvf deepnlp-0.1.7.tar.gz
    cd deepnlp-0.1.7
    python setup.py install
```

* Initial setup
```python
    # install crf++0.58 package using the script
    sh ./deepnlp/segment/install_crfpp.sh
    # Download all the pre-trained models
    python ./test/test_install.py
    
    # Or Download pre-trained models from below command lines
    import deepnlp
    deepnlp.download('segment')
    deepnlp.download('pos')
    deepnlp.download('ner')
    deepnlp.download('parse')

```

* Running Examples
```python
    # ./deepnlp/test folder
    cd test
    python test_segment.py    # segmentation
    python test_pos_en.py       # POS tag
    python test_ner_zh.py       # NER Zh
    python test_ner_domain.py   # NER domain-specific models
    python test_ner_dict_udf.py # NER load user dict and UDF for disambiguation
    python test_nn_parser.py    # dependency parsing
    python test_api_v1_module.py
    python test_api_v1_pipeline.py
```

Tutorial
===========
Set Coding
---------------
设置编码
For python2, the default coding is ascii not unicode, use __future__ module to make it compatible with python3
```python
#coding=utf-8
from __future__ import unicode_literals # compatible with python3 unicode

```

Download pretrained models
---------------
下载预训练模型
If you install deepnlp via pip, the pre-trained models are not distributed due to size restriction. 
You can download full models for 'Segment', 'POS' en and zh, 'NER' zh, zh_entertainment, zh_o2o, 'Textsum' by calling the download function.

```python
import deepnlp
# Download all the modules
deepnlp.download()

# Download specific module
deepnlp.download('segment')
deepnlp.download('pos')
deepnlp.download('ner')
deepnlp.download('parse')

# Download module and domain-specific model
deepnlp.download(module = 'pos', name = 'en') 
deepnlp.download(module = 'ner', name = 'zh_entertainment')

```

Segmentation
---------------
分词模块
```python
#coding=utf-8
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from deepnlp import segmenter

tokenizer = segmenter.load_model(name = 'zh_entertainment')
text = "我刚刚在浙江卫视看了电视剧老九门，觉得陈伟霆很帅"
segList = tokenizer.seg(text)
text_seg = " ".join(segList)

#Results
# 我 刚刚 在 浙江卫视 看 了 电视剧 老九门 ， 觉得 陈伟霆 很 帅

```

POS
-----
词性标注
```python
#coding:utf-8
from __future__ import unicode_literals

import deepnlp
deepnlp.download('pos')

## English Model
from deepnlp import pos_tagger
tagger = pos_tagger.load_model(name = 'en')  # Loading English model, lang code 'en', English Model Brown Corpus

text = "I want to see a funny movie"
words = text.split(" ")     # unicode
print (" ".join(words))

tagging = tagger.predict(words)
for (w,t) in tagging:
    pair = w + "/" + t
    print (pair)
    
#Results
#I/nn want/vb to/to see/vb a/at funny/jj movie/nn

## Chinese Model
from deepnlp import segmenter
from deepnlp import pos_tagger
tagger = pos_tagger.load_model(name = 'zh') # Loading Chinese model, lang code 'zh', China Daily Corpus

text = "我爱吃北京烤鸭"
words = segmenter.seg(text) # words in unicode coding
print (" ".join(words))

tagging = tagger.predict(words)  # input: unicode coding
for (w,t) in tagging:
    pair = w + "/" + t
    print (pair)

#Results
#我/r 爱/v 吃/v 北京/ns 烤鸭/n

```

NER
------------
命名实体识别
```python

from __future__ import unicode_literals   # compatible with python3 unicode

import deepnlp
deepnlp.download('ner')  # download the NER pretrained models from github if installed from pip

from deepnlp import ner_tagger

# Example: Entertainment Model
tagger = ner_tagger.load_model(name = 'zh_entertainment')   # Base LSTM Based Model
#Load Entertainment Dict
tagger.load_dict("zh_entertainment")
text = "你 最近 在 看 胡歌 演的 猎场 吗 ?"
words = text.split(" ")
tagset_entertainment = ['actor', 'role_name', 'teleplay', 'teleplay_tag']
tagging = tagger.predict(words, tagset = tagset_entertainment)
for (w,t) in tagging:
    pair = w + "/" + t
    print (pair)

#Result
#你/nt
#最近/nt
#在/nt
#看/nt
#胡歌/actor
#演的/nt
#猎场/teleplay
#吗/nt
#?/nt

```

Parsing
------------
依存句法分析

```python

from __future__ import unicode_literals # compatible with python3 unicode coding

from deepnlp import nn_parser
parser = nn_parser.load_model(name = 'zh')

#Example 1, Input Words and Tags Both
words = ['它', '熟悉', '一个', '民族', '的', '历史']
tags = ['r', 'v', 'm', 'n', 'u', 'n']

#Parsing
dep_tree = parser.predict(words, tags)

#Fetch result from Transition Namedtuple
num_token = dep_tree.count()
print ("id\tword\tpos\thead\tlabel")
for i in range(num_token):
    cur_id = int(dep_tree.tree[i+1].id)
    cur_form = str(dep_tree.tree[i+1].form)
    cur_pos = str(dep_tree.tree[i+1].pos)
    cur_head = str(dep_tree.tree[i+1].head)
    cur_label = str(dep_tree.tree[i+1].deprel)
    print ("%d\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s" % (cur_id, cur_form, cur_pos, cur_head, cur_label))

# Result
id	word	pos	head	label
1	它	r	2	SBV
2	熟悉	v	0	HED
3	一个	m	4	QUN
4	民族	n	5	DE
5	的	u	6	ATT
6	历史	n	2	VOB

```

#coding:utf-8
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from deepnlp import pipeline
p = pipeline.load_model('zh')

#Segmentation
text = "我爱吃北京烤鸭"
res = p.analyze(text)

print (res[0].encode('utf-8'))
print (res[1].encode('utf-8'))
print (res[2].encode('utf-8'))

words = p.segment(text)
pos_tagging = p.tag_pos(words)
